Task Management System


This is a sample Go gRPC application that allows you to manage tasks. The application consists of a server and a client that communicate using the gRPC protocol.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the application, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

Go
protoc compiler
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd task-management-system/example.com/task-management-system/
Generate the Go code for the Protocol Buffers file:

bash
Copy code
protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. proto/tasks.proto
Build the server binary:

go
Copy code
go build -o server server.go
Build the client binary:

go
Copy code
go build -o client client.go
Usage
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
./server
This will start the server and listen for incoming gRPC requests on port 50051.

Open another terminal window and navigate to the same directory.

Run the client:

bash
Copy code
./client
This will run the client code and make gRPC requests to the server. The server will log the requests and respond accordingly.
